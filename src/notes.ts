inputs.
After that, it will decide what's next. Until it's created, nothing else is getting touched. I need order.
This will take care of a few things:
Pomodoro's
Mindmapping
.... with the ability to add %complete to items and calc an overall total of project complete
Incoming events (think, calendars but the items coming towards you) in ultraDOM format.
prioritising tasks based on time to do, energy levels, body, mind, fuel, time of day
balancing socials and family time with it
Almost like a PA except neural net powered.

This feels so natural. And gives me the chills as I can help people like me.

Plan:
Front end, back end with database, running locally. AWS for the DB, amplify for pushing, react for frontend, and plenty of CSS.

- We understand the endless pursuit to gain order from chaos. We see you. [ ]
- If you find life easy, we probably aren't for you...
... But if you've ever
... started making a hot drink then cleaned the kitchen as the kettle boils
... with your backpack half on and your headphones in
... but misplaced your socks just as you remember you forgot to actually play a song
... and the kettle's gone cold and you forgot about the kitchen
... then welcome home. We see you. [ ]

Personal Scalping: dedicate 1hr/day. Scalping Doge and SHIB - easily done.
Try to pull the API and bang analyse for trends/my patterns
ultradom - generate market states file from calculated data (maybe fs)

- Manage your day through this app...
- Dashboard
- Day planner (mamager as I'm not disciplined without it)
- Energy levels. Mark regularly.
- Monitor coffee and food intake.
- Supplement reminders and dosage tracking, link the data to output levels and measure correlations.
- Pomodoro timer at top.
- Todo list as 3d cards where you can cycle through them like a rolodex.
- Ideas have their own section.
- Twitter has its own section, like Tweetdeck where I can post code etc right to carbon-sh.
- Rather than add todos as items of parents, seperate out projects individually.
